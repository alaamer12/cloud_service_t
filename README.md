# About
this project is a practice of the three top cloud providers AWS, Azure, and GCP

# Note
we tried to see if we can make a simple cloud service by our own but it looks like even a simple one considered a complex project

we have also thought to make projects like SaaS, DaaS, ...etc.
but it looks like we can not make any of them because to make those projects u need a cloud service provider
and u have to ways to get a cloud service:
    - to make it
    - to use existing vendors providers

so because of that i think our optimal solution to make one of these projects is to use a cloud provider

# References
we have checked Azure, and it needs credit card as well as GCP
but it looks like AWS does not need a credit card.
